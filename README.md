Seize That is a local deals app based around competition with other users. Business owners post deals that they have and then customers can see listings of all the deals based on how close they are in proximity to them. The idea is that deals would be low in quantity to give users an urge to go out and seize that deal sooner rather than later.

Future implementations would include:
* Subscriptions to companies to get:
    * Push notifications upon new deals being posted
    * Subscriber only deals
* Achievements for seizing deals
* Categories for better searching through deals
* Friend and sharing integration to better spread businesses
